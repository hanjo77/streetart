# StreetArt

This shall become an open street art gallery where users can register and upload their favourite pictures of street art. The pictures will be located on a map and tagged to be rediscovered or remembered even if they should be removed in the meanwhile.

## Technology

The gallery is built on

* Python 2.7
* Django 1.8.4
* jQuery 2.2.4
* Google Maps API v3

## Installation

To install this gallery on your own environment, consider to install first the Python modules `ExifRead` and `SimpleKML`, preferably using `PIP`:

`pip install ExifRead`
`pip install SimpleKML`

Then, change the file `streetart/settings.py` according to your preferences, change the variable `mapApiKey` in `media/scripts/map.js` to your own Google Maps API Key and go to the root directory of this repository and setup the database:

`python manage.py makemigrations`
`python manage.py migrate`
`python manage.py collectstatic`

Eventually, open `127.0.0.1:8000` in your browser.
